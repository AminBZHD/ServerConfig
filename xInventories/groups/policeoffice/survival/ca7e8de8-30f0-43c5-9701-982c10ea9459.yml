        New Changes§0
        §0============§0
        §0
        §0So the following changes are now in effect:§0
        §0
        §0(1) When you use the /onduty command while in the Police Office you will stay on duty for the entire time you are at the Office§0
      - |-
        (2) If you use the /onduty command while anywhere else it will give you 2 minutes on duty before converting you back to a mortal.§0
        §0
        §0Why?: Because we gave you the power to be able to enforce rules, but would still like you to play as a regular player
      - "and enjoy the super heros made available to you. §0\n§0\n§0You can stay on\
        \ duty in the office, but anywhere else its just used to enforce rules.§0\n\
        §0\n§0(3) There is now a private staff lounge and deck area where private\
        \ staff meetings can be held and "
      - |-
        private one on one conversations. §0
        §0
        §0Currently only Sergeants have access to it, but can invite other Officers in for a chat. Its so if Sergeants are meeting, other officers dont try to eavesdrop.
      - |-
        (4) There is now a mail room attached to the locker room. You've obviously discovered it. Check your mailbox regularily. I will leave notices in your mail.§0
        §0
        §0(5) Every day I will reset the pressure plates found in front of your mailbox
      - |-
        The pressure plates will pay you your daily wage. Do not take from another Officer. I will know.§0
        §0
        §0If you have noticed someone has taken your pay then advise me immediately and I will investigate.§0
        §0
        §0Thanks for all your hard work!

      - |-
        There is also /warn (player) (reason) that will appear in chat to the public to see.  Once they are warned the player will have to visit /warp rules to read the rules.§0

        §0Every time a player is warned or arrest, it goes inside the CRIMINAL DATABASE.

        §0
        §0An officer can also do /checkfingerprints (player) and everytime a player gets arrested or warned their IP gets logge
